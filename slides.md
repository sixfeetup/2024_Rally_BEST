# Peak Performance {.r-fit-text .original data-background-image="images/slide1.png"}

::: notes
- Nowadays, the world runs on software
- If you want to stay competitive, you will want to be as productive and efficient as possible. 
    - Common pain points: 
        - managing and scaling engineering teams
        - poor delivery velocity
        - aligning technical efforts with strategic business goals
:::

# Journey {data-background-image="images/space_journey.png"}

* 6 Globally Distributed Teams
* Some Poorly Performing
* Goal to Improve Delivery Velocity
* Assumptions:
  * Poor Test Coverage?
  * Technical Debt?

::: notes
engaged 6 teams to interview a subset of people from each team
80 hours of work for the 6 teams
:::

# The Discovery {data-background-image="images/space_discovery.png"}

* Interviewed 6 Teams
* Used a sampling of people
* About 6 hours per team in just interviews
* Uncovered many more issues

::: notes
Out of over 30 teams
Using our own internal knowledge as a guide

::: notes
We discovered that there were more issues to blame
But there were some teams with strong practices
The story of Pete and Andy
:::

# Where to start? {.r-fit-text data-background-image="images/space_building.png"}

- Rely on surveys, not interviews
- Aggregate results at the team level
- Identify areas of synergy

::: notes
- Interviews are time-consuming and biased:
  - not everybody was invited
  - not everybody who was invited spoke their minds
  - a survey would be much better
    - make sure it aggregates results at the team level, not the individual level
:::

# DIY Assessments {data-background-image="images/space_diy.png"}

- Identify your best SDLC practices
- Order them according to priority
- Develop questions with only 3 options (for ease of scoring)
- Have everyone take the survey
- Identify your internal domains of expertise and leverage them
- Repeat every 6 months and monitor progress
